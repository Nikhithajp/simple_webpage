<p> <h2>Sending flowers to anyone you know that is sick or sad might be the go-to gift, but the sending of flowers is actually more helpful than you think. It might surprise you, but there are more to flowers than just the look and smell—they can have some really positive effects on your health as well.<br>Giving and receiving flowers is a great way to improve the emotional health of both giver and recipient.  While we often don’t think to give flowers to men, men in particular proved to react positively to receiving flowers in a Rutgers study, displaying an increase in eye contact, social patience, and smiling. <i> Who knew!</i><br><br>

<br>The easiest way to reap the benefits of flowers is to simply place them in your home. The results of a study suggest placing flowers by your bedside, so they’re the first thing you see when you wake up and start the day.  Participants reported having a better outlook throughout the morning after placing flowers throughout the house as they went about their morning routines.  Placing flowers in the foyer or dining room welcomes guests into your home with a burst of positivity and inclusivity.
